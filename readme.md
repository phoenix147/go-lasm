# GO-LASM (Lower Austria Smart Meter)

**!!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!**

Go-LASM is a wrapper around the smart meter portal of Lower Austria (Netz Niederoesterreich).

Since the data is only available up to the previous day, it is mainly used to import data from the smart meter portal to a local database.

The `cmd` package provides a simple usage example.
